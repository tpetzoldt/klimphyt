\usage{
phyto_peak_summary(
  phyto_series,
  peak_obj,
  max_peak_len,
  use_interpolation = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyto_series}{A data frame containing the phytoplankton time series.
It must include columns for \code{date} and \code{bv} (biovolume).}

\item{peak_obj}{An object (e.g., a data frame or list) that identifies
individual peaks in the time series, typically containing a \code{peakid}
column.}

\item{max_peak_len}{A numeric value to filter out and suppress
abnormally long peaks.}

\item{use_interpolation}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, the function uses
linear interpolation to more accurately estimate the peak's start time, end
time, and integrated value. If \code{FALSE} (default), it uses a simpler,
non-interpolated method based on the first and last data points above a
threshold.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing each identified peak with columns for:
\itemize{
\item \code{date}: The first date of the peak.
\item \code{Nr}: The unique peak ID.
\item \code{Tstart}: The start time of the peak.
\item \code{end}: The end time of the peak.
\item \code{Ymax}: The maximum biovolume of the peak.
\item \code{Dpeak}: The duration of the peak.
\item \code{Skew}: A measure of the peak's skewness.
\item \code{Fint}: The integrated area of the peak (only available with interpolation).
\item \code{Year}: The year of the peak.
}
}
\description{
This function takes a time-series of phytoplankton data with identified peaks
and calculates key summary metrics for each peak, such as its start time,
duration, maximum value, and skewness. It offers an optional mode to use linear
interpolation for more precise start, end, and integrated values.
