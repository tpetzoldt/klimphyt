\title{Calculate Peak Duration and Integrated Value}
\usage{
calc_peak_duration(x, y, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of x-coordinates (e.g., time or day of year).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of y-coordinates (e.g., abundance or value).}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value defining the minimum height for a point to be
considered part of the peak.}
}
\value{
A list containing three numeric values:
\itemize{
\item \strong{start}: The interpolated start time of the peak.
\item \strong{end}: The interpolated end time of the peak.
\item \strong{Fint}: The integrated area under the curve above the threshold.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the duration and the integrated area above a specified
threshold of an identified peak in a time series data set. It uses linear
interpolation to find the start and end points of the peak and then applies numerical
integration (trapezoidal rule) to compute the total area under the curve above
the threshold.

\examples{
# Create sample data
set.seed(42)
x_vals <- 1:20
y_vals <- c(rep(0, 5), runif(10, 0.5, 2.5), rep(0, 5))
y_vals[c(6, 10, 15)] <- c(0.8, 1.2, 0.9)

# Define the threshold
threshold <- 0.1

# Run the function
result <- calc_peak_duration(x_vals, y_vals, threshold)

print(result)
